# template manager plugin
This plugin adds support for inserting a template into the composer window via a UI.

Based on cpradio's [Checklist Plugin](https://github.com/cpradio/discourse-plugin-checklist)

## Still not quite useful

I have a working plugin. It puts a button in the composer that will
let you select from several templates. However, if you want to change
the templates, you have to edit the code, so I have a bit more to
learn to make a template editing interface in settings. This isn't bad
for a days' work, though.

I still don't recommend that anyone use this.

## Installation

Follow the directions at [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157) using https://github.com/pfaffman/discourse-plugin-template-manager.git as the repository URL.
